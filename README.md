# TestProject

This app was generated by the [App Generator](https://www.yworks.com/app-generator/) (v1.8.0) for yFiles.

It integrates [yFiles for HTML](https://www.yworks.com/products/yfiles-for-html) in a
[create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) application with TypeScript and loads graph data from
a source customized in the App Generator.

**To run this project, a valid [yFiles for HTML](https://www.yworks.com/products/yfiles-for-html) version is required.
You can evaluate yFiles 60 days free of charge on [my.yworks.com](https://my.yworks.com/signup?product=YFILES_HTML_EVAL).**

## Version Information

- react-scripts (create-react-app) 3.4
- react 16.14
- TypeScript 3.9
- yFiles for HTML 2.6

## Getting Started

Install required dependencies with

```
npm install
```

If this fails, the yFiles library is probably located at a different location than provided when this app was generated.
In this case fix the paths in the `dependencies.yfiles` and `scripts.postinstall` fields of the `package.json` file.

You can serve the application on [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/) with

```
npm run dev
```

## What's Next?

This basic application can be used as a starting point to test the capabilities of yFiles or to implement
your own use case. yFiles for HTML comes with a lot of [source-code demos](https://live.yworks.com/demos/index.html)
that show different aspects of the library.

You can browse through the demos and look for features that you find interesting for your use case and integrate it
in this basic component to build a more sophisticated application.

Furthermore, there is an extensive [Developer's Guide](https://docs.yworks.com/yfileshtml/#/dguide/introduction#top)
that covers anything from graph creation and styling to automatic layouts and advanced customizations.
